# About


 In today's time! Social media is everywhere. Everyone is addicted to it! Even the children. That worries their parents about the content they consume on social media and that results in restriction on children for      using social media. 
 <br></br>
 But they do not need to worry now! We have a
        *__SOLUTION__*!
<br></br>
 *__GreatShare__* is a content moderated platform that uses ML & AI to detect
          whether the content is safe for the users or not. GreatShare moderates
          content and ensure the exclusion of profanity, threatening language,
          and other unwanted content including photos.
  With this platform, kids can enjoy the amusement of social media, and
        parents can be carefree about the content consumed by their kids.

## Challanges we faced

We were new to cockroachDb so integrating it with our app was a big challenge for us.
The other challenge we faced was coming up with an automatic moderation check system using clarifai API.


## Accomplishment that we are proud of


We were able to come up with a great idea and were also able to implement is while using so many new technologies we are definetely proud of this.


## What we learned?

We were able to learn about many technologies such as cockroachDB, twillio, the clarifai API apart from this we are were also able to learn about team work .



## What's next for GreatShare?


GreatShare aims on improving continuously. We are always looking forward to improve our quality. Our goals right now are to scale up and add more features and add content moderation for videos.
